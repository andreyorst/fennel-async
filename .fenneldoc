 :modules-info {:async.fnl {:description "A library for asynchronous programming for the Fennel language and Lua
runtime.

This library provides facilities for asynchronous programming by
implementing a coroutine scheduler and various synchronization
primitives.

To use this library require its main module and use it as the function
to spawn threads:

``` fennel
(local async (require :async))

(local p (async.promise))
(local thread-1 (async (fn [] (async.sleep 400) (async.deliver p 42))))
(local thread-2 (async (fn [] (print (async.await p 100 :not-delivered)))))
(print (async.await p))
```

In the example above a promise is created and two threads are spawned.
The first thread sleeps for 400ms and delivers a promise.  The second
thread awaits for promise with a timeout of 100ms and prints
`not-delivered` because the promise wasn't realized yet.  Lastly, the
promise is awaited in the main thread, blocking the execution, while
threads are cooperating. As a result, `42` is printed.

For more examples see the project's [wiki](https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/fennel-async/-/wikis/home)."
